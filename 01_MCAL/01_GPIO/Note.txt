/*************************************************************/
- 4 Bit 2 for Mode and 2 for Config for pin so Option = 16 for pin
- Mode (Input ,Output-->High speed ,Output-->Meduim speed , Output-->Low speed)
- Config as Input  : (Analog , Floating, PullUPorDown , Reserved)
- Config as Output : (Pushpull,OpenDrain, ALF(0..15)PushPull ,ALF(0..15)OpenDrain  )

*Input Option Config : 
- Analog Any pin Can be ADC
- Floating  : Sensitive For High And Low Used With  Sensor 
- PULL_DOWN : Sensitive For High Only(defulat) ---> Internal Ground
- PULL_UP   : Sensitive For Low Only  ---> Internal vcc good with Avoid Noise
-----> For Pull Up Or Down -->Anthor REG 

* Output Option Config : 
- Pushpull      : The Normal Mode So 1=3.3V --> High & 0 = 0V -->lOW 
- OpenDrain     : 0 Conect The Ground = 0 But When you Write 1 -->Will be Floating = Disconnect From The MicroController 
 * The benfit of open drain floating  --> You Can Connect Any Volt External So Here 1 Not = 3.3V And Current Not = 25MA bUT Any Value You Can Put It With Out Afrid About Micro
 * 1 = External Power Supply So High Level is Configrable Any value I need without any transistor
 * Must have resistance -> In Case Of Zero Not Make Short Crircuit . 
 * Second Binfet The Open Drain bUS -->  
- ALF PushPull  :Not For GPIO and It's Push Pull
- ALF OpenDrain : Not For GPIO and It's OpenDrain Like CAN And Lin

BSRR reg = ODR --> But Faster in ASSEMBLY Without OR you Can Write pin set or Reseat 
BRR REG --> Reast Only 
Write on ODR on input mode make it Pull_up
