*) Some thing cut my backgroung loop while(1) 
*) Only 1 pin when it have pulse ya processor there is intterput .
*) Type : (External & Internal ) of processor but poth in micro
	*) External : uart , adc , timer , .......
	*) Internal : 	
			*)Core peripheral : ( rcc , systick  , ... ),*)
			*)Trap  :( Mistake like div 5/0 , Wrong opcode ,stack oversflow )
			*) SWI  : Software int when processor find instruction swi prossecor make INT .

*) With intterput processor jump to ISR .

*) Function call vs SWI :


*) 1 pin for intterput how all peripheral on the same pin  --> By connect all pif in PIC : Programmable intterput controller .
*) Every peripheral have (PIEx) : that for enable perpheral intterput i can Enable or disable intterput go to out or not flag will raise but pic will not feel .
*) GIE : That global intterput enable PIC Will never feel any flag from any peipheral . 
*) NMI : nonmaskable intterput never can control it like resat . 
*)   how processor know how have interput ? ( Vector table , Flexiable prority system )
	*) To know how make intterput :
				1) Vector table const location  : pic before extern flag svae number for peripheral 
				2) processor read PIC .
				3) Processor have Vectortable have same location of pic so processor jump to vector table to location which read .
				4) here processor will find address of ISR for the spasific perpheral intterput . 
*) what will happen if many peripheral out intterput in same time ?
--> we have latch mem save intterput and out it by periority and here order of peripheral = peririty order of arrang hw .
 
*) where vector table ? 

*) who put isr location in vector ||?   

*) The disadvantage of vector the prority only HW .

*) Flexiable prority system : Here processor get intterput only no vetor table 
--) here with any intterput jump for vector not vector table 
--) here we have only one ISR Not for every peripheral ISR here only one ISR and as sw by if ( if INT get falg make code )
--) here when 2 isr happend i same time the arrange of if condition here is the prority so i can control it not by hardware .
--) but use if if if not if else .

*) Vector table better at intterput latency but hw prority . AVR --> Vector table , Pic --> flexable 
) ARM BOTH . 
--------) we must clear flag to fell intterput 
			*) by (HW , Write (0|1) , Read flag) 
*)nesting : interput can cut anthor intterput .
-> normal nesting : that intterput cut anthor one 
-) Self nesting :
